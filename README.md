# Project Title

Simple overview of use/purpose.

## Description

Asynchronous bestfightodds.com scraper that can take a dataframe of fights and return a dataframe of odds. Alternatively, it can scrape all UFC events for odds data. This is built for my specific purposes and do not intend to support this beyond what works for me. Pull requests gladly accepted though.
